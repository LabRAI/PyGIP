# PyGIP - GNN Ownership Verification Module

This repository contains the integration of **Graph Neural Network (GNN) ownership verification** experiments into the PyGIP framework. It provides modular and extensible implementations for attacks and defenses on GNNs, following the guidelines of the PyGIP framework.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This module allows users to:  

- Evaluate ownership verification on GNN models (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE).  
- Run experiments under **inductive** and **transductive** settings.   
- Easily extend the framework with new datasets, attacks, or defenses.

> **Note:** Large model weights (`benign_model.pth`) and result folders (`temp_results/`, `robustness_results/`) are excluded to keep the repository clean.
