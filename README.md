PyGIP is a Python library designed for experimenting with graph-based model extraction attacks and defenses. It provides
a modular framework to implement and test attack and defense strategies on graph datasets.

## Installation

To get started with PyGIP, set up your environment by installing the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher recommended) along with the necessary libraries listed
in `requirements.txt`.

Specifically, using following command to install `dgl 2.2.1` and ensure your `pytorch==2.3.0`.

```shell
pip install dgl==2.2.1 -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/torch-2.3/repo.html
```

cuda (cu121)

```shell
pip install dgl==2.2.1 -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/torch-2.3/cu121/repo.html
```

## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s a simple example to launch a Model Extraction Attack using PyGIP:

```python
from datasets import Cora
from models.attack import ModelExtractionAttack0

# Load the Cora dataset
dataset = Cora()

# Initialize the attack with a sampling ratio of 0.25
mea = ModelExtractionAttack0(dataset, 0.25)

# Execute the attack
mea.attack()
```

This code loads the Cora dataset, initializes a basic model extraction attack (`ModelExtractionAttack0`), and runs the
attack with a specified sampling ratio.

And a simple example to run a Defense method against Model Extraction Attack:

```python
from datasets import Cora
from models.defense import RandomWM

# Load the Cora dataset
dataset = Cora()

# Initialize the attack with a sampling ratio of 0.25
med = RandomWM(dataset, 0.25)

# Execute the defense
med.defend()
```

which runs the Random Watermarking Graph to defend against MEA.

If you want to use cuda, please set environment variable:

```shell
export PYGIP_DEVICE=cuda:0
```
